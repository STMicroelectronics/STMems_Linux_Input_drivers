* stts22h driver for temperature MEMS sensors

Required properties:
	- compatible : should be "st,stts22h"
	- reg : the I2C address of the sensor

Example for an i2c device node with pull down on SD0:

stts22h-temp@38 {
	compatible = "st,stts22h";
	reg = <0x38>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull up on SD0:

stts22h-temp@3f {
	compatible = "st,stts22h";
	reg = <0x3f>;
};
