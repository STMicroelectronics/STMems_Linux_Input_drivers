* lsm6dsox driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,lsm6dso"
              "st,lsm6dsox"
              "st,lsm6dso32"
              "st,lsm6dso32x"

Optional properties for all bus drivers:
- st,drdy-int-pin: must be one of:
              <1> - Route Tilt/Step_D/Step_C/Sign_M events interrupt on int pin 1
	      <2> - Route Tilt/Step_D/Step_C/Sign_M events interrupt on int pin 2
  if not defined default value is int pin 1

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Example for an spi device node:

lsm6dsox-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsox";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull down on SD0:

lsm6dsox-imu@6a {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsox";
	st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
	reg = <0x6a>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull up on SD0:

lsm6dsox-imu@6b {
	compatible = "st,lsm6dsox";
	st,drdy-int-pin = <1>;
	reg = <0x6b>;
};
