* asm330lhh driver for imu MEMS sensors

Required properties for all bus drivers:
- compatible: must be one of:
              "st,asm330lhh"
              "st,lsm6dsr"
              "st,ism330dhcx"

Optional properties for all bus drivers (more details reported in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt):
- interrupt-parent = This property is used to specify the controller to
                     which interrupts are routed.
- interrupts =       Interrupts listed here are always in reference to
                     the node's interrupt-parent.

Required properties for the i2c bindings:
- reg: i2c slave address

Required properties for the spi bindings:
- reg:               the chipselect index
- spi-max-frequency: maximal bus speed, should be set to 1000000 unless
                     constrained by external circuitry

Example for an spi device node:

asm330lhh-imu@0 {
	compatible = "st,asm330lhh";
	reg = <0x0>;
	spi-max-frequency = <1000000>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull down on SD0:

asm330lhh-imu@6a {
	compatible = "st,asm330lhh";
	reg = <0x6a>;
};

Example for an i2c device node with pull up on SD0:

asm330lhh-imu@6b {
	compatible = "st,asm330lhh";
	reg = <0x6b>;
};
